My name is Chris, and I operate the CoalNova devblog. It is a means to report and relay information on, and in relation to, the development of [CoalStar](https://github.com/CoalNova/CoalZig). I am not CoalNova exactly. CoalNova isn't a person, but the effort put forth into the CoalStar project. Think of it as a dev team of (currently) one. In time perhaps it will be many people working together towards that goal, but that is perhaps wishful thinking on my part.
