This is the official Development Weblog for the CoalStar Engine project, and the subsequent projects built within.

CoalStar is a video game engine project. The goals of the engine are dedicated openworld, with seamlessly traversable landforms much larger than most seen in the current market. As well, an emphasis is placed on player movement and interactions, creating a less rigid engagement with the worldspace as a whole. The ideal complete form is an an open world RPG system that players can fully explore and engage with, without the necessary macro/micro scaling necessary in current implementations.

I am, at the time of this writing, the sole developer of the project. I consider myself an amatuer at programming, C++ or otherwise, so the codebase is to remain hidden at this time (if only to save myself shame and embarrassement). All information presented within the blog may change at any time due to the needs of expedited releases, changes in project scope, and/or a complete misunderstanding of what certain systems/subsystems/goals require. 

This blog uses Jekyll, which I am uncertain as to how to classify. Link is below.
