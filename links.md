## CoalStar Information

A link for those interested in a breakdown of the development process may be found at the Trello board, [found here](https://trello.com/b/WMep4bf6/coalstar-development).

## CoalStar Demonstrations
The lowest grade of hardware verified for these demos is an AMD R5 APU dual core with 4GB of shared RAM.

[CoalStar Engine Demo 0.0.1](https://mega.nz/file/LhlCVapL#OYIqpqonNO9ahLczQaZ6Zdggmq5jbUROF0T__Sbyucs) **(DL Size: 63.0MB - Install Size: 8.02GB)** - This was the first demo, and was meant to portray the terrain projection system, as well as basic mesh and LOD swapping with billboards. 

[CoalStar Engine Demo 0.0.2](https://mega.nz/file/aocVmaCD#4yy16iWCCU8DAh3Ec-iSEO0GA9va4a15mg52f5K7aWA) **(DL Size: 1.34GB - Install Size: 1.62GB)** - This was a complete rewrite. It displays the same features as before, but with a more believable terrain form, basic sun and directional lighting, automatic texture management, metadata-based object loading system, and zlib compression techniques to reduce size. It also uses a software-driven output window in place of the default console window.

## Other Game Projects
[TicTacToe](https://mega.nz/file/7t9C3ZbD#lSQqX84eIYY2zw6eYgAwnEezadeXD4vvif8AwqQw-o0) **(DL Size: 1.22MB - Install Size: 4.91MB)** - What the name implies, tic tac toe vs an ai player, made in C++ with the SDL library.

[CubeQuest](https://mega.nz/file/iw10CC5R#4j5FxeKc5BY_8adYyNtntgI-3SBhj99zn0hB8nwKB3w) **(DL Size: 5.94MB - Install Size: 22.0MB)** - An old cube-rolling game made in Unity. Exists only as a hobby project and is in no way to be misrepresented as a marketable product to be purchased, sold, consumed, played, or comprehended.
