&emsp; I suppose that the term "creating a world" could mean different things. In some ways, the immediate thought is on brain storming. Creating a (sometimes) cohesive collection of locations, usually filled with groups of individuals which move and react much as people in the real world. Creating a world could also be more tactile, implementing or modeling simulated versions of those locations and people. The third way is the least (I feel) discussed, but the most important. Filling the mind of the audience enough that they themself propogate further ideas and take partial ownership of it.

&emsp; If I estimated, visual arts are the most easily adopted for the later, with literary second, and auditory third. My reasoning is that humans are primarily visual creatures, even when we percieve a situation, we see it through the "mind's eye". Video games are primarily a visual medium, you can play a game without audio, or simple arcade-esque games which contain no narrative, but a game with no visuals would not really be considered a "video" game. A small few experimental games exist which challenge this notion, but it is by no means a mainstay.  

&emsp; World creation in video game can be abstract or literal. It is often abstracted away enough to remove the dull elements we associate with the real world, as well to remove development complexity and technical cost. A game can contain a fantastical world without investing very heavily in showing it mechanically. It can utilize images of landscapes, intertwined lore, thought-provoking writing, or even just the creation of a familiar mood in setting.

&emsp; All that being said, I'm entirely insane. I am perplexed that newer technology isn't used to facilitate bringing those worlds into the foreground technically and mechanically. I remember so many interesting worlds that painted images of towns, cities, people, and cultures, but never allowed them to be experienced. Regardless of the effort involved in undertaking this task, a first step must be taken.

&emsp; Terrain mesh tracking is complete, at least functionally. It requires some tweaks to range distance be suitable. Multithreading has been implemented for generating new world, but is a direct implementation. It is nowhere near what the multithreading system will need to be.
