Not quite a year later. Many things have shifted, and of that which has remained I see with a new perspective.

To recount changes to the project:

 - I have fully invested into integral dimensional coordinates, as the benefits of piggybacking on rounding are just too good to ignore.

 - Focus (focal point) objects are now childed to the window, to prevent problems with losing context with relevant relational chunkdata.

 - The language has been moved to Zig. Though daunting and time consuming, it has proven a good move, as it has exposed problems and problematic design patterns I previously had no perspective on. Zig also offers error handling, stack tracing, more granular type casting and memory allocation. Zig offers builtin support of the C language, which I cannot overstate is a godsend.

 There are obvious downsides to moving the codebase over to another language, time in adjusting. Obvious cheats performed before are no longer acceptable, certain dangerous operations are completely impossible. Along with the ever-present temptations and opportunities to fix broken designs and try new things.

 Moving forward I will need to keep some sort of schedule for this devblog, if only to maintain production efforts. And clarity.
